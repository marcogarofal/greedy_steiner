SOLUTION SUMMARY WITH CUSTOM COST FUNCTION
================================================================================

COST FUNCTION: C(G) = Œ± * ACC + (1-Œ±) * AOC
Œ± = 0.5
ACC = (Œ£ w_ij * x_ij) / (n(n-1)) - Average Communication Cost
AOC = (Œ£ overload_j * d_j * y_j) / n - Average Operational Cost (OVERLOAD ONLY)
Where overload_j = max(0, usage_j - capacity_j) - only overload contributes to cost
      d_j = node degree, y_j = node selected
This formulation favors load distribution over node count minimization
